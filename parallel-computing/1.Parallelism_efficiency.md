## Course Themes and Objectives

The lecture introduces three core themes of the CS149 course, each focusing on a different aspect of parallel computing:

### Course Theme 1: Designing and Writing Parallel Programs That Scale
- **Parallel Thinking:**
  1. **Decomposing Work:** Break down tasks into pieces that can be safely executed in parallel.
  2. **Assigning Work:** Distribute these tasks to multiple processors.
  3. **Managing Communication/Synchronization:** Ensure that communication and synchronization between processors do not bottleneck performance.
- **Abstractions/Mechanisms:** Use popular parallel programming languages to implement these tasks effectively.

### Course Theme 2: Parallel Computer Hardware Implementation
- **Mechanisms for Efficient Implementation:**
  - Understand the performance characteristics of hardware implementations.
  - Explore design trade-offs, such as performance versus convenience versus cost.
- **Why Hardware Knowledge Matters:**
  - The characteristics of the machine significantly impact performance, especially for communication (e.g., speed of data movement).
  - Efficiency and performance are critical for parallel programming, requiring an understanding of the underlying hardware.

### Course Theme 3: Thinking About Efficiency
- **Fast ≠ Efficient:** A program running faster on a parallel computer does not necessarily mean it is using the hardware efficiently.
  - Example Question: Is a 2x speedup on a computer with 10 processors a good result? (The answer is no, as it suggests underutilization of resources.)
- **Programmer’s Perspective:** Focus on making effective use of the machine’s capabilities.
- **Hardware Designer’s Perspective:** Choose the right capabilities to optimize the system, balancing performance and cost (e.g., silicon area, power consumption).

## Historical Context: Evolution of Processor Performance

The lecturer provides a historical perspective on why parallelism became essential, reflecting on the evolution of processor performance:

- **Exponential Growth in Performance (Pre-2000s):**
  - Historically, processor performance grew exponentially, as shown in a logarithmic plot by Kunle from nearly 20 years ago (circa 2003). Each year, Intel would release a new CPU that ran programs faster without any changes to the software.
  - This meant that even if a student wrote a parallel program, the next year’s sequential processor might outperform it, diminishing the need for parallelism at the time.
  - **Reasons for Performance Gains:**
    1. **Transistor Scaling:** Smaller transistors allowed for higher clock frequencies and more transistors on a chip.
    2. **Architectural Innovations:** Hardware architects used additional transistors to automatically parallelize code (e.g., through superscalar execution) and increase CPU clock frequency.

- **Stagnation of Single-Threaded Performance (Post-2000s):**
  - **Transistor Growth vs. Performance:** A graph illustrates that while the number of transistors per chip (green line) continued to grow (e.g., modern NVIDIA chips have ~85 billion transistors), the operations per clock (purple line) plateaued.
    - Studies at Stanford showed that beyond 3–4 operations per clock, additional execution units were underutilized due to limited parallelism in programs.
  - **Clock Frequency Limits:** Clock frequency (dark blue line) stopped increasing around 15 years ago (circa 2008) due to power constraints.
    - Power consumption scales with the square of frequency ($P \propto f^2$), making frequency increases inefficient.
    - Example: An NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU at full tilt consumes power comparable to a microwave, highlighting the heat and cooling challenges.
  - **Shift to Parallelism:** With frequency and automatic parallelism hitting limits, the only way to leverage more transistors was for programmers to explicitly write parallel code, leading to the rise of multi-core processors.

- **Modern Multi-Core Systems:**
  - Today’s systems, from laptops to supercomputers, rely on parallelism:
    - AMD chips with 64 cores.
    - NVIDIA RTX 4090 with 18,000 floating-point multipliers.
    - Supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of CPU cores, consuming megawatts of power.
    - Even mobile devices (e.g., iPhones, Android phones) and embedded systems feature multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
  - **Specialized Hardware:** Efficiency demands have led to specialized cores:
    - Apple’s iPhone processor has 6 CPUs (2 high-performance, 4 low-power for background tasks) and dedicated units for camera, neural networks, and sensors.
    - Companies like Google (TPUs) and Facebook are building specialized hardware for machine learning.

## Foundational Concepts: What is a Computer Program?

The lecture introduces fundamental concepts to ensure a shared understanding:

- **Definition of a Computer Program (from the Computer’s Perspective):**
  - A computer program is a list of instructions or commands that a processor executes.
  - Example: A C program is translated (via a compiler or interpreter) into a sequence of hardware instructions (e.g., x86 or ARM assembly).
  - The lecturer emphasizes that the medium (e.g., text) is less important than the concept of instructions.

- **What Does a Processor Do?**
  - A processor executes these instructions, which involves:
    1. **Performing Computations:** E.g., arithmetic operations like addition or multiplication.
    2. **Control Flow:** Jumping to different parts of the program (e.g., branches).
    3. **Accessing Memory:** Reading or writing to memory.
    4. **Changing State:** Modifying the values in registers or memory.
  - **Processor Diagram (Simplified):**
    - **Control Unit (Orange):** Manages the instruction stream, fetching and decoding instructions to determine the next operation.
    - **Execution Unit (Yellow):** Performs arithmetic or logical operations (e.g., ALUs for addition, multiplication).
    - **Execution Context (Blue):** Stores the program’s state, including register values and memory.
  - Example: For an instruction like `add R0, R1, R0` (add contents of R0 and R1, store in R0):
    - The processor fetches values from R0 and R1 (e.g., 42 and 54).
    - It computes the sum (42 + 54 = 96).
    - It updates R0 with the result (96), modifying the program’s state.

- **Execution Model:**
  - In the simplest model, a processor executes one instruction per clock cycle, taking 5 cycles for a 5-instruction program.
  - However, parallelism can improve performance if instructions are independent.

## Introduction to Parallelism: Superscalar Execution

The lecture introduces the concept of parallelism within a single core using superscalar execution, a hardware technique that exploits instruction-level parallelism (ILP):

- **Example Program:**
  - Compute $a = x*x + y*y - z*z$, with registers R0 = x, R1 = y, R2 = z.
  - Instruction sequence:
    1. `mul R0, R0, R0` (R0 = x*x)
    2. `mul R1, R1, R1` (R1 = y*y)
    3. `mul R2, R2, R2` (R2 = z*z)
    4. `add R0, R0, R1` (R0 = x*x + y*y)
    5. `add R3, R0, R2` (R3 = x*x + y*y - z*z)

- **Dependencies:**
  - Instructions 1, 2, and 3 are independent (no data dependencies) and can be executed in parallel.
  - Instruction 4 depends on instructions 1 and 2 (needs their results).
  - Instruction 5 depends on instructions 3 and 4.
  - This dependency graph limits the parallelism but allows some instructions to run concurrently.

- **Superscalar Execution (Idea #1):**
  - A superscalar processor automatically identifies independent instructions in a single instruction stream and executes them in parallel on multiple execution units.
  - Example: With two execution units, instructions 1, 2, and 3 can be executed in parallel:
    - Cycle 1: Execute instructions 1 and 2.
    - Cycle 2: Execute instruction 3.
    - Cycle 3: Execute instruction 4 (after 1 and 2 complete).
    - Cycle 4: Execute instruction 5 (after 3 and 4 complete).
  - This reduces the execution time from 5 cycles to 3 cycles, even though the program was written sequentially.
  - **Key Insight:** The program’s semantics (results must match sequential execution) are preserved, but the processor reorders instructions to exploit parallelism without the programmer’s intervention.

- **Historical Impact:**
  - Superscalar execution was a major reason why more transistors translated into performance in the 1990s and early 2000s.
  - Example: A Pentium 4 processor could execute up to 3–4 instructions per clock using multiple execution units and out-of-order execution logic (e.g., Tomasulo’s algorithm).
  - However, studies showed that beyond 3–4 operations per clock, the inherent parallelism in programs was limited, leading to diminishing returns.

## Memory and Caches: Addressing Latency Challenges

The lecture introduces the concept of memory and the role of caches in mitigating latency:

- **What is Memory (Programmer’s Perspective)?**
  - Memory is an abstraction: a logical array of bytes where each address maps to a value.
  - Example: Address 0x0 holds value 16, address 0x1 holds 255, etc.
  - Instructions can read (load) or write (store) to memory:
    - `mov R0, [42]` loads the value at address 42 into R0 (e.g., R0 = 42).
    - The state changes by updating R0, while memory remains unchanged.

- **Implementation of Memory:**
  - **DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory):** The primary storage for memory, located off-chip, with high latency (~100s of cycles).
  - **Latency Challenge:** Accessing DRAM can take hundreds of cycles, causing the processor to stall (wait) if the next instruction depends on the data.

- **Stalls:**
  - A processor stalls when it cannot execute the next instruction because it depends on a previous instruction that hasn’t completed.
  - Example:
    ```
    ld R0, mem[R2]  # Load from memory into R0
    ld R1, mem[R3]  # Load from memory into R1
    add R0, R0, R1  # Add R0 and R1, store in R0
    ```
    - The `add` instruction cannot execute until the loads from `mem[R2]` and `mem[R3]` complete, which may take hundreds of cycles if the data is in DRAM.
  - **Memory Access Time:** Latency is a measure of this delay, often in the order of 100s of cycles.

- **What Are Caches?**
  - **Definition:** A cache is a hardware implementation detail that does not affect program correctness but improves performance.
  - **Purpose:** Caches are on-chip storage that maintain a copy of a subset of memory values, providing faster access than DRAM.
    - If an address is in the cache (a “hit”), the processor can load/store it quickly.
    - If not (a “miss”), the data must be fetched from DRAM, which is slower.
  - **Cache Lines:** Caches operate at the granularity of cache lines (e.g., 4 bytes in the example, typically 64 bytes in real systems).
    - Example: Accessing address 0 brings the entire cache line (addresses 0–3) into the cache.
  - **Cache Example:**
    - Cache capacity: 2 lines, each holding 4 bytes.
    - Memory access sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, ...
    - **Access 0:** Not in cache (miss), fetch cache line 0x0–0x3 (values 16, 255, 14, 0).
    - **Access 1, 2, 3:** Already in cache (hits), no need to access DRAM.
    - **Access 2, 1:** Still in cache (hits), exploiting temporal locality (reusing recently accessed data).
    - **Access 4:** Not in cache (miss), fetch cache line 0x4–0x7 (values 0, 0, 6, 32), evicting the least recently used line if the cache is full.
  - **Benefits of Caches:**
    - **Temporal Locality:** If data is accessed once, it’s likely to be accessed again soon (e.g., accessing address 2 again).
    - **Spatial Locality:** If data at address 0 is accessed, nearby addresses (1, 2, 3) are likely to be accessed soon, so fetching a whole cache line prefetches nearby data.
  - **Latency Hierarchy (To Scale):**
    - L1 cache hit: ~4 cycles (a few kilobytes).
    - L2/L3 cache hit: Slightly longer.
    - DRAM access: ~250 cycles, significantly slower.

## Why Parallelism and Efficiency Matter

The lecture concludes by tying together the need for parallelism and efficiency:

- **Single-Threaded Performance Plateau:**
  - Single-threaded performance is improving very slowly due to limits in clock frequency and automatic parallelism.
  - To achieve significant speedups, programs must utilize multiple processing elements (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs) or specialized hardware.

- **Challenges of Parallel Programming:**
  - Requires problem partitioning, communication, and synchronization.
  - Knowledge of machine characteristics (e.g., memory latency, cache behavior) is crucial.
  - Data movement is a key bottleneck, as highlighted by the lecturer: “Moving data to the right place is going to be the most important thing we talk about in the class.”

- **Efficiency in Modern Systems:**
  - Modern computers have tremendous processing power (e.g., 18,000 floating-point multipliers on an NVIDIA RTX 4090), but this power must be used efficiently.
  - Example: On a quad-core laptop, well-written parallel C++ code can achieve 30x–40x speedups over sequential code, even with only 4 cores, due to efficient use of hardware features like caches and parallel execution units.

- **Specialized Hardware for Efficiency:**
  - General-purpose cores are being replaced by specialized cores for specific tasks (e.g., neural networks, camera processing), as seen in Apple’s iPhone chips and Google’s TPUs.
  - This trend reflects the need for efficiency in power-constrained environments, from mobile devices to large-scale supercomputers.

## Key Takeaways

- **Parallelism is Essential:** With single-threaded performance stagnating, parallelism (via multi-core, GPUs, and specialized hardware) is the only way to achieve significant speedups.
- **Efficiency is Critical:** Speed alone is not enough; programs must use hardware resources efficiently, considering factors like data movement and cache utilization.
- **Foundational Concepts:**
  - A computer program is a list of instructions that modify the machine’s state (registers and memory).
  - Processors execute these instructions, performing computations, control flow, and memory access.
  - Caches reduce memory latency by exploiting temporal and spatial locality, but data movement remains a key challenge.
- **Superscalar Execution:** Hardware can automatically parallelize independent instructions, but this is limited by program dependencies.
- **Data Movement:** Efficient parallel programs must manage data movement, as memory latency (e.g., DRAM access) can cause significant stalls.

## Additional Context

- **Out-of-Order Execution:** The lecture briefly mentions out-of-order execution (e.g., Tomasulo’s algorithm) as a key mechanism in superscalar processors. This allows the processor to reorder instructions dynamically to maximize parallelism, even in the presence of dependencies.
- **Modern Cache Sizes:** While the lecture uses a simplified example (2 cache lines, 4 bytes each), modern CPUs have larger caches: L1 caches are typically 32–64 KB per core, L2 caches are 256 KB–1 MB, and L3 caches can be 10s of MB shared across cores.
- **Power Constraints:** The power-frequency relationship ($P \propto f^2$) is a simplified model. In reality, power also depends on voltage ($P \propto V^2 f$), and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is used in modern processors to balance performance and power.

This lecture sets the foundation for deeper discussions on parallel programming, hardware mechanisms, and efficiency, emphasizing the interplay between software and hardware in achieving high-performance computing.
