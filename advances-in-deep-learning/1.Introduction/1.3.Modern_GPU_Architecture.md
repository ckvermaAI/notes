# Modern GPU Architecture

## High-Level GPU Architecture
### GPU Overview
- **GPUs as Parallel Processors**: GPUs are designed for massive parallelism with components like streaming processors and tensor cores. These execute the same instructions simultaneously across multiple cores within a "warp."

### NVIDIA H100 Architecture Details
- **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**:
  - The H100 GPU contains approximately **130 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)**.
  - Each SM is a block of processors capable of executing parallel instructions.
- **Cores per SM**:
  - Each SM has **128 cores** for FP32 precision calculations. The core count varies slightly for other precisions like FP16 or INT8.
- **Memory Architecture**:
  - **Global Memory**: 80 GB of memory, shared across all SMs, but accessing this memory incurs high latency.
  - **L2 Cache**: Shared cache between SMs, acts as a middle layer to reduce latency.
  - **L1 Cache and Shared Memory**: Each SM contains about **200 KB of shared memory** and additional L1 cache for program instructions.
- **Warp Structure**:
  - SMs are divided into **warps**, with each warp having **32 cores**.
  - A warp shares a single scheduler and dispatch unit, meaning all 32 cores execute the same instruction at a time.
- **Memory Bandwidth**:
  - Shared memory operations are faster compared to global memory accesses.
  - Data transfer latency increases significantly when accessing memory outside the SM.
- **Power and Scalability**:
  - The H100 GPU supports multi-GPU setups in nodes, typically **8 to 16 GPUs per node**, with inter-GPU communication facilitated by **NVLink**.
  - Large-scale setups include data centers with up to **40,000 nodes**, consuming nearly 0.42 gigawatts of power solely for GPU operations.

## Bottlenecks in GPU Computation
- The primary bottleneck in GPU operations is **memory bandwidth**, not computational power.
- **Data Transfer Latency**:
  - Loading data from global memory to processors is slow compared to computation.
  - Memory reads and writes, especially from the host machine to the GPU, add significant latency.

## Maxpool_1D Implementation Example
- **Problem Setup**: Compute the maximum value for every sliding window in a sequence.
- **Approaches**:
  1. **Naïve Brute Force** (Python): Double for-loop implementation; computationally expensive (O(n × w) runtime).
  2. **Heap-Based Optimization** (CPU): Reduces complexity to O(n log w) by using a heap structure.
  3. **GPU-Based Implementation**: Uses CUDA for parallelizing the outer loop, achieving significant speedups.
  4. **Memory-Optimized Implementation**:
     - Leverages shared memory in GPUs to minimize global memory access.
     - Saves repeated computation across overlapping windows.
  5. **Cumulative Max Trick**:
     - Splits the problem into sub-windows using cumulative max in forward and reverse directions.
     - Highly efficient, reduces memory operations, and is implementable in PyTorch with minimal lines of code.

## Key Insights on GPU Efficiency
- **Memory Bandwidth Dominates**: Memory operations, not computation, often limit performance.
  - GPUs can perform thousands of floating-point operations per memory access.
- **Hierarchy Matters**:
  - Communication between GPUs (e.g., via NVLink) and between data center nodes is slower than intra-GPU memory operations.
- **Optimization Trade-Offs**:
  - Clever memory access patterns (e.g., caching and minimizing data transfers) often yield more significant speedups than focusing solely on computational optimization.

## Challenges and Future Scope
- **Scaling Limitations**:
  - Current GPU architectures are approaching physical limits in power consumption and memory size.
  - Further improvements might come from enhanced memory technologies and optimized hardware communication protocols.
- **Energy Efficiency**:
  - High power requirements (e.g., data centers with GPUs consuming 40% of a nuclear power plant's output) make efficiency a critical concern.

This lecture emphasized that efficient GPU utilization depends on understanding and mitigating memory access bottlenecks while leveraging its immense parallel processing capabilities.
