# Long Context

This lecture addresses the challenges of handling long contexts in large language models (LLMs), focusing on memory and speed limitations when processing sequences beyond the typical pre-training length of 2,000 to 8,000 tokens. It introduces **activation beacons** to compress context and **RoPE scaling** to manage positional embeddings, enabling LLMs to handle extended sequences (e.g., up to 100,000 tokens). The lecture builds on prior discussions of training, tuning, tool use, and structured outputs, using LLaMA 3 as an example.

## Introduction and Context

- **Recap**:
  - **Training and Tuning**: Covered pre-training, fine-tuning, and alignment of LLMs to meet user expectations.
  - **Efficiency**: Explored techniques to make training and inference faster, enabling LLMs to run on consumer hardware (e.g., 8-year-old GPUs, laptops).
  - **Tool Use**: Discussed how LLMs can use tools via special syntax and chat templates.
  - **Structured Outputs**: Examined methods to produce parseable outputs without full tool integration.
- **Problem Statement**:
  - Most LLMs are pre-trained on 2,000 to 8,000 tokens, but real-world tasks often require processing longer sequences (e.g., multiple documents or short books).
  - **Question**: What happens when input exceeds this length at inference time?

## Challenges with Long Contexts

### Issue 1: Memory Constraints

- **Problem**: Feeding more tokens into an LLM fills the **KV (key-value) cache**, used for attention mechanisms, leading to memory exhaustion.
  - **Mechanism**: Attention looks back at the entire sequence, adding a new element to the KV cache per token.
  - **Impact**: For models like LLaMA 3 (70B), memory runs out between 20,000 and 50,000 tokens on modern GPUs.
- **Temporary Fix**: Techniques exist to reduce KV cache size (e.g., pruning, quantization), but these only delay the inevitable memory limit.

### Issue 2: Speed Degradation

- **Problem**: Longer sequences slow down inference due to attention’s computational complexity.
  - **Runtime**: At inference, attention scales as $ O(L) $ per token, where $ L $ is the sequence length, making generation slower as $ L $ increases.
- **Naive Solution**: Truncate the context window (e.g., remove early tokens), but this risks disrupting the LLM’s understanding, as it encounters inputs outside its training distribution.

## Solution 1: Activation Beacons for Context Compression

- **Concept**: Train LLMs to process long sequences in chunks, summarizing each chunk with special **beacon tokens** to compress context.
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Chunking**: Process the input in 1,000-token chunks.
  - **Beacons**: Within each chunk, insert beacon tokens that summarize the preceding tokens in that chunk.
    - Beacons are meaningless within their own chunk (attention already sees all tokens), but they carry summary information forward.
  - **Propagation**: Append beacons (not original tokens) to the next chunk, allowing the LLM to reason over compressed summaries.
  - **Iteration**: Repeat for subsequent chunks, maintaining a compressed context.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Base Model**: Start with a pre-trained LLM.
  - **Adapter**: Add a self-attention head to attend to beacons.
    - Within the same chunk: Regular attention to beacons.
    - Across chunks: Concatenate beacons to the next chunk’s sequence and attend to them.
  - **Training**:
    - For short sequences: Train on concatenated 1,000-token chunks, allowing forward and backward passes through beacons to update prior activations.
    - For longer sequences: Likely copy beacon values without gradients to avoid processing the entire sequence, though the paper lacks detail.
    - **Robustness**: Vary beacon frequency during training to make the model adaptable to different beacon structures.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Memory**: Reduces KV cache size by compressing context into fewer beacon tokens.
  - **Speed**: Limits attention to smaller chunks, avoiding \( O(L) \) scaling across the entire sequence.
- **Limitation**: If the sequence exceeds the maximum trained length, the model may produce garbage outputs (e.g., repeated patterns or tokens), as it operates outside its training distribution.

## Solution 2: RoPE Scaling for Positional Embeddings

- **Context**: The primary reason for garbage outputs in long sequences is the failure of **positional embeddings** to extrapolate beyond training lengths.
- **Positional Embeddings Overview**:
  - **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: Used in most modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3).
    - **Mechanism**: Encode positions as rotations in 2D space using sine and cosine functions.
    - **Properties**:
      - **Relative**: Sensitive to the distance between tokens (e.g., dot product yields \( \cos(p_1 - p_2) \) or \( \sin(p_1 - p_2) \)).
      - **Absolute Encoding**: Can be used in standard attention without relative computation.
  - **Extrapolation Issue**:
    - RoPE embeddings are trained on a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 2,000 tokens).
    - Beyond this range, embeddings produce erratic values (e.g., magnitudes up to 8,000 vs. the trained range of ±3), disrupting the network.
    - **Example (Paper: Extending the Context Window of LLMs via Positional Interpolation)**: Extrapolating from 0 to 2,000 to longer ranges results in wild oscillations.
- **Solution: RoPE Scaling**:
  - **Approach**: Instead of extrapolating, **interpolate** by stretching the trained embeddings over a longer sequence.
    - Example: If trained on 2,000 tokens but given 4,000 tokens, scale the embeddings to treat the sequence as "denser" (e.g., positions are twice as close).
  - **Interpolation Performance**:
    - RoPE embeddings interpolate smoothly (e.g., first 80 positions show a stable curve).
    - No magnitude blow-up, unlike extrapolation.
  - **Impact on Model**:
    - Relative order is preserved, but absolute distances are compressed (e.g., tokens appear closer together).
    - LLMs are robust to this compression, with minimal performance degradation.
- **Adoption**: RoPE scaling has become standard in the last 1–1.5 years, widely used in modern LLMs to handle extended contexts.

## Practical Implementation: Scaling LLaMA 3

- **Pre-Training Limitation**:
  - Most models are pre-trained on 2,000 to 8,000 tokens due to efficiency constraints (e.g., slow training, high hardware demands).
- **Scaling Strategy**:
  - **LLaMA 3 Approach**:
    - Start with short sequences (e.g., 2,000 tokens).
    - Towards the end of pre-training, apply RoPE scaling to extend the context to 100,000 tokens.
  - **Challenges**:
    - Requires sequence parallelism and smaller batch sizes, increasing computational cost.
    - Helps the model learn the scaling factor for rotary embeddings.
  - **Fine-Tuning**: Post-pre-training, fine-tuning can use arbitrary-length contexts, leveraging the scaled embeddings.
- **Outcome**: Enables LLMs to process multiple documents or short books (e.g., 100,000 tokens).

## Limitations and Future Directions

- **Remaining Issues**:
  - **Hardware Limits**: Even with activation beacons and RoPE scaling, memory and speed constraints persist at extreme lengths (e.g., 1–few million tokens).
  - **Garbage Outputs**: Beyond trained lengths, models may still produce repetitive or nonsensical outputs due to extrapolation issues.
- **Next Steps**: The next segment will explore solutions for contexts beyond hardware limits (e.g., millions of tokens), addressing memory and speed bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

- **Summary**: Long contexts challenge LLMs with memory (KV cache overflow) and speed (\( O(L) \) attention) issues. Activation beacons compress context into 1,000-token chunks with summary tokens, solving memory and speed problems but failing beyond trained lengths. RoPE scaling interpolates positional embeddings to handle longer sequences (e.g., 100,000 tokens in LLaMA 3), avoiding extrapolation issues. Despite these advances, hardware limits persist, setting the stage for future exploration.
- **Context (March 17, 2025)**: Techniques like activation beacons and RoPE scaling are standard in modern LLMs, with LLaMA 3 exemplifying their application to real-world tasks like document processing.

### Additional Context

- **Historical Note**: RoPE scaling gained prominence around 2023–2024, with papers like "Extending the Context Window of LLMs via Positional Interpolation" (2023) formalizing its use. Activation beacons emerged around the same time as a complementary technique.
- **Applications**: Long-context LLMs are critical for tasks like legal document analysis, book summarization, and multi-document question answering.
- **Research Trends**: Focus is shifting to million-token contexts, with techniques like sparse attention, hierarchical memory, and external memory systems (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) gaining traction. Open-source frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers are integrating RoPE scaling and beacon-like mechanisms.
