# Quantization in Large Language Models

## A) **Why Do We Need Quantization?**
- **Memory Constraints**: Large language models like Llama 70B have billions of parameters, requiring massive memory storage for:
  - Weights
  - Gradients
  - First and second momentum
- **Inference Challenges**:
  - Even inference requires **4N bytes** for weights.
  - The Llama 70B model exceeds the memory capacity of most GPUs, requiring **high-end GPUs (e.g., A100, H100)** or multiple GPUs to run.
  - High-speed GPU memory (e.g., HBM3) is expensive and physically challenging to scale up on single GPUs.

## B) **Can We Go Lower?**
- **Reducing Precision**:
  - Moving from **FP32 to FP16** reduces memory requirements (e.g., Llama 70B to fit on high-end gaming GPUs).
  - Precision loss primarily occurs in the **fraction** part of floating-point numbers, not the sign or exponent.
- **Issues with Small Precision (e.g., FP8, FP4)**:
  - Smaller precision formats like FP8 or FP4 cause:
    - **Loss of fine-grained differences**.
    - **Truncation errors** during repeated computations.
  - FP4, for example, is unsuitable due to its limited range and inability to represent meaningful weight distributions.

## C) **Integer Quantization**
- Converts floating-point values to integers with either:
  1. **Scale Quantization**: Maps values proportionally between `[-T, T]` (maximum range).
  2. **Affine Quantization**: Maps values based on `min` and `max` of the weight distribution, allowing finer granularity for asymmetric distributions.

### Quantization Process:
1. Compute the max/min weight range.
2. Map weights to integers using rounding.
3. Store quantized weights with reduced memory requirements.

## D) **Limitations of Integer Quantization**
- **Sensitivity to Outliers**:
  - A single large weight can skew the quantization range, resulting in:
    - Poor precision for smaller weights.
    - Collapsing many weights into the same bin.

## E) **Blockwise Quantization for Outliers**
- **Solution**:
  - Divide weights into **blocks** and compute separate quantization ranges for each block.
  - Store block-specific max/min values with the weights.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces the impact of outliers.
  - Provides finer quantization granularity per block.

### Memory Overhead:
- Adds extra storage for block-specific ranges (e.g., ~16/S bits per parameter, where S = block size).

## F) **Double Quantization**
- **Concept**:
  - Quantize the **quantization constants** themselves (e.g., block ranges).
- **Advantages**:
  - Further reduces memory usage by a significant factor.
  - Effective for squeezing out additional compression without significant precision loss.

## G) **Limitations of Quantization**
- **Training vs. Inference**:
  - Quantization is most effective for **inference**.
  - Training requires higher precision to avoid:
    - Gradient truncation errors.
    - Loss of precision during momentum updates.
  - Fine-tuning or adapters are trained post-quantization in full precision.
- **Extreme Quantization**:
  - Beyond 4–6 bits, models suffer noticeable performance drops.

## H) **8-bit Adam and Stochastic Rounding**
- **8-bit Adam**:
  - Optimizer that quantizes momentum terms:
    - First momentum: **int8 (signed)**.
    - Second momentum: **uint8 (unsigned)**.
  - Reduces memory from 16/32 bits to **8 bits per parameter** while retaining stability.
- **Stochastic Rounding**:
  - Probabilistically rounds up/down based on proximity to the nearest value.
  - Prevents systematic rounding bias, ensuring small gradients have an impact.

## I) **How Low Can We Go?**
- **Optimal Quantization Levels**:
  - Practical range: **4 to 6 bits** for modern LLMs without significant performance degradation.
  - Theoretical limit: **2 bits per parameter** (under ideal conditions).
- **Empirical Results**:
  - Llama 3.1 model perplexity:
    - **No difference between FP16 and 6-bit quantization.**
    - **4-bit** shows minor precision loss.
    - **3-bit** results in significant degradation.
- **Compression Insight**:
  - Large language models can store **2 bits of information per parameter**, making compression highly efficient.

## Additional Notes
- **Advanced Quantization Techniques**:
  - Learned quantization with **lookup tables** instead of fixed bins.
  - Custom floating-point formats for dynamic ranges.

## Conclusion
Quantization is an essential tool for making large language models memory-efficient, especially for inference. With innovations like blockwise quantization, double quantization, and stochastic rounding, we can achieve optimal memory savings while maintaining performance. However, quantization for training remains limited and requires further development to match full-precision training performance.

# Understanding `block_quantize_4bit` Implementation

```python
def block_quantize_4bit(x: torch.Tensor, group_size: int = 16) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:
    """
    Quantize the input tensor to 4-bit precision along the last dimension.
    Always quantize group_size value together and store their absolute value first.
    To keep things simple, we require x to be a 1D tensor, and the size divisible by group_size.
    Return the quantized tensor and scaling factor.
    """
    assert x.dim() == 1
    assert x.size(0) % group_size == 0
    x = x.view(-1, group_size)
    normalization = x.abs().max(dim=-1, keepdim=True).values
    x_norm = (x + normalization) / (2 * normalization)
    x_quant_8 = (x_norm * 15).round().to(torch.int8)

    x_quant_8[:, ::2] = x_quant_4 & 0xF
    x_quant_8[:, 1::2] = (x_quant_4 >> 4) & 0xF
    x_norm = x_quant_8.to(torch.float32) / 15

    return x.view(-1)
```


## 1) Why are we casting to `torch.int8` instead of `torch.int4`?

Theoretically, `int4` (4-bit integer) should suffice, but **PyTorch does not support `int4`** as a data type. The smallest integer dtype available in PyTorch is **`torch.int8`** (8-bit integer).

Since we need to store 4-bit values, the **workaround** is to:
- Store two 4-bit values in a **single** 8-bit integer.
- This way, we reduce the memory footprint **by half**, compared to storing 8-bit values directly.

---

## 2) What is stored in `x_quant_4`, and why do we need this operation?

### What `x_quant_4` stores:
- `x_quant_4` is an **efficient storage format** where **each element** contains **two 4-bit values packed into one byte (8 bits)**.
- The elements of `x_quant_4` are still `int8`, but **each byte contains two 4-bit values**.

### Why do we need this?
- **Memory Efficiency**:  
  - If we store 4-bit values in `int8`, each value will take **1 full byte**, wasting 4 bits.  
  - Instead, we **pack two 4-bit values into one byte**, reducing memory usage by half.  
- **Efficient Computation**:  
  - When using quantized values in **matrix multiplication or inference**, efficient unpacking and SIMD operations (e.g., bitwise operations) help speed up computation.

### Reduction in Size:
- The input tensor has **N elements**.  
- After quantization, we pack **two values into one byte**, so the output (`x_quant_4`) has **N/2 elements**.

## 3) Explanation of `x_quant_4 = (x_quant_8[:, ::2] & 0xF) + ((x_quant_8[:, 1::2] & 0xF) << 4)`

This line **packs two 4-bit values into one 8-bit integer**. Let’s break it down:

### Step 1: Understanding `x_quant_8`
- `x_quant_8` is an `int8` tensor, but **only the lowest 4 bits of each value are meaningful**.
- It contains values **in the range [0, 15]** because `x_quant_8 = round(x_norm * 15)`.
- Example:  
  ```
  x_quant_8 = [3, 12, 7, 9, 14, 1, 6, 4]  
  ```

### Step 2: Extract even-indexed and odd-indexed values
- `x_quant_8[:, ::2]` → Selects values at **even indices** (0, 2, 4, ...)  
  ```
  [3, 7, 14, 6]  # (4-bit values from even positions)
  ```
- `x_quant_8[:, 1::2]` → Selects values at **odd indices** (1, 3, 5, ...)  
  ```
  [12, 9, 1, 4]  # (4-bit values from odd positions)
  ```

### Step 3: Masking with `0xF` (`& 0xF`)
- `& 0xF` ensures we only keep the **lower 4 bits** of each value.
- Since `x_quant_8` is already in range `[0, 15]`, this operation doesn't change anything.

### Step 4: Packing the two values together
We combine two 4-bit values into one 8-bit integer:
- The **even-indexed values** go in the **lower 4 bits**.
- The **odd-indexed values** go in the **upper 4 bits** (`<< 4` shifts them left by 4 bits).

#### Example Calculation:
```
Even  = 3, 7, 14, 6   (Lower 4 bits)
Odd   = 12, 9, 1, 4   (Upper 4 bits, shifted left)
```
```
Packed = (3  + (12 << 4))  = 3  + 192  = 195
Packed = (7  + (9  << 4))  = 7  + 144  = 151
Packed = (14 + (1  << 4))  = 14 + 16   = 30
Packed = (6  + (4  << 4))  = 6  + 64   = 70
```
Final output:
```
x_quant_4 = [195, 151, 30, 70]  (Stored in int8 format)
```

---

## **Summary**
- **Using `int8` instead of `int4`** is necessary because PyTorch **does not support `int4`**.
- **Packing two 4-bit values into one byte** (using bitwise operations) **saves 50% memory**.
- The expression `x_quant_4 = (x_quant_8[:, ::2] & 0xF) + ((x_quant_8[:, 1::2] & 0xF) << 4)`:
  - Extracts values from even and odd indices.
  - Packs them into a single byte using bitwise shifting and addition.
