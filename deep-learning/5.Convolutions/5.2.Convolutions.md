# Convolutions in Deep Learning

## Introduction to Convolutions
Convolutions are a fundamental operation in deep learning, originally designed to process images or image-like data efficiently. This lecture explores their role, mechanics, and advantages in handling spatial data, particularly images, in deep neural networks.

## Understanding Images
### Image Structure
- **Tensor Representation**: An image is a three-dimensional tensor with dimensions: channels, height, and width.
  - **Channels**: Typically, there are three channels—red, green, and blue (RGB). Some images include an alpha channel (transparency), while hyperspectral images (e.g., satellite imagery used in agriculture) may have additional channels.
  - **Height and Width**: These define the spatial dimensions of the image in pixels.
- **Pixel Values**: Each pixel in a channel holds an integer value from 0 to 255.
  - 0 represents black (no intensity).
  - 255 represents full intensity (e.g., full red, green, or blue; white when all channels are 255).
- **Class Focus**: For simplicity, this lecture assumes images with three RGB channels.

### Channel-First Format in PyTorch
- **Format**: PyTorch adopts a channel-first format `(channels, height, width)`, unlike the more common `(height, width, channels)` used outside deep learning.
- **Historical Context**: This design stems from the original Torch library (written in Lua), carried over to PyTorch.
- **Critique**: The lecturer considers this a mistake due to computational inefficiencies:
  - **Memory Layout**: In channel-first format, pixel values for a single spatial location are spread across distant memory locations, slowing down operations that process entire channels simultaneously.
  - **Performance**: Channel-last formats are faster because they align better with how deep learning operations (e.g., convolutions) access data on GPUs.
- **PyTorch Flexibility**: PyTorch supports channel-last via a `memory_format` option, but this is nonstandard and avoided in the class to maintain cleaner code and compatibility with PyTorch’s library, which expects channel-first.
- **Class Notation**: The lecture sticks to channel-first for consistency in code and discussion.

## Challenges of Processing Images with Fully Connected Networks
### Image Size
- **Scale**: Images are massive compared to other data types (e.g., text).
  - A 1024x1024 pixel image with 3 channels has $1024 \times 1024 \times 3 = 3,145,728$ input values.
  - Text documents typically have thousands or tens of thousands of characters, orders of magnitude smaller than images.
- **Comparison**: Videos are larger, but images rank as the second-largest raw input data type in deep learning.

### Issues with Fully Connected Layers
- **Flattening**: To use a fully connected (FC) network, an image must be flattened into a single vector (e.g., 3,145,728 values for a 1024x1024x3 image).
- **Parameter Explosion**:
  - Feeding this into a linear layer with, say, 4000 output units requires a weight matrix of size $3,145,728 \times 4000$.
  - Total parameters: $3,145,728 \times 4000 \approx 12.58$ billion (plus biases, ~13 billion).
  - **Context**: This rivals the size of large language models (e.g., 13 billion parameters), but here it’s just one layer, making it impractical for training on modern hardware due to memory and compute constraints.
- **Fixed Size Limitation**:
  - FC networks trained on a specific image size (e.g., 1024x1024) cannot process images of different resolutions without preprocessing (e.g., resizing), reducing flexibility.
- **Conclusion**: Flattening and feeding images through FC layers is unfeasible due to size and rigidity.

## Alternative: Patch-Based Approaches
### Plan B: Independent Patch Processing
- **Concept**: Divide the image into non-overlapping patches (e.g., $k \times k \times 3$), processing each with a separate linear layer.
- **Parameters**: For a patch of size $k \times k \times 3$, input size is $3k^2$. If the image has $m$ patches and output dimension is $t$, each patch’s linear layer has $3k^2 \times (t/m)$ parameters.
  - Total parameters: $m \times (3k^2 \times t/m) = 3k^2 \times t$, reduced from $3 \times height \times width \times t$ by a factor of $m$.
- **Savings**: Reduces memory and computation compared to full image flattening.
- **Drawback**: No communication between patches, losing global context (e.g., an object split across patches is harder to recognize).

### Improved Patch Approach: Shared Weights
- **Concept**: Use the same linear network for all patches, further reducing parameters.
- **Parameters**: Total parameters become $3k^2 \times (t/m)$, independent of image size (unlike the original $3 \times height \times width \times t$).
- **Efficiency**: Scales with patch size, not image resolution, saving significant memory.
- **Issue**: Still no communication between patches, and objects may be fragmented across non-overlapping patches.

## Convolutions: The Solution
### Definition and Operation
- **Concept**: Convolutions process overlapping patches, applying the same linear transformation (kernel) across the image.
- **Process**:
  - Extract a patch (e.g., $k \times k \times 3$).
  - Apply a linear transformation via a kernel (weight matrix).
  - Slide the kernel over the image, producing outputs at each spatial location.
- **Mathematical Formulation**: For an input image $I$ with $C$ channels and kernel $W$ of size $k \times k$, output $O$ at position $(x, y)$ is:
  $O(x, y) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} \sum_{i=-k/2}^{k/2} \sum_{j=-k/2}^{k/2} W(c, i, j) \cdot I(c, x+i, y+j) + b$
  - $W(c, i, j)$: Kernel weight for channel $c$ at position $(i, j)$.
  - $b$: Bias term.
- **Kernel Dimensions**: $W$ has shape $(C_{in}, k, k, C_{out})$, where $C_{in}$ is input channels and $C_{out}$ is output channels.

### Output Dimensions
- **Shrinkage**: For an input of size $(C_{in}, H, W)$ and kernel size $k$, the output size is $(C_{out}, H - k + 1, W - k + 1)$, reducing spatial dimensions due to the sliding window.

### Efficiency Advantages
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Parameters depend only on kernel size and channels, not image size.
  - Example: A 3x3 kernel with 3 input and 3 output channels has $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ parameters, vs. billions for an FC layer.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Local operations and weight sharing leverage GPU parallelism, accelerating computation.
- **Comparison**: For a 1024x1024x3 image, an FC layer might need ~13 billion parameters, while a convolution needs fewer than 500.

### Trade-Off
- **Locality**: Each output sees only a local patch (receptive field), not the entire image, unlike FC layers.

## Receptive Field
- **Definition**: The receptive field is the input region influencing a specific output unit in a convolutional layer.
- **Locality**: In shallow layers, it’s small (e.g., $k \times k$). In deeper networks, it grows as layers stack, capturing broader context.
- **Computation**:
  - **Analytical**: Derived from kernel sizes and strides.
  - **Empirical**: Computed by:
    - Backpropagating NaNs to trace influence.
    - Probing with NaN inputs to observe output changes.
  - Covered in hands-on segments.
- **Modern Networks**: Deep architectures ensure receptive fields exceed image size, mitigating locality limitations.

## Spatial Properties Preserved by Convolutions
- **Shift Invariance**: Shifting the input shifts the output equivalently, inherent to the sliding kernel.
- **Cropping**: Cropping the input crops the output proportionally.
- **Robustness**:
  - **Rotation**: Learned during training, not by design.
  - **Scaling**: Partially learned, enhanced by training data diversity.
- **Fit for Images**: These properties align with image invariances, unlike FC layers.

## Convolutions as Filters
- **Signal Processing View**: Convolutions apply filters to the input signal:
  - **Box Filter**: A kernel with equal weights (e.g., $1/(k^2)$) averages pixels, blurring the image.
  - **Edge Detection**: Kernels can detect gradients (e.g., increasing/decreasing intensity).
- **Adaptability**: Unlike fixed filters, convolutional kernels are learned, tailoring to data-specific features.

## Why Use Convolutions?
- **Efficiency**: Fast computation and minimal memory usage due to weight sharing and locality.
- **Compactness**: Processes spatial signals with few parameters.
- **Structure Preservation**: Maintains spatial hierarchies and invariances.
- **Adaptability**: Learns filters suited to the task, enhancing flexibility.

## Conclusion
Convolutions are a cornerstone of image processing in deep learning, offering a balance of efficiency, memory savings, and structural preservation. They enable scalable, effective processing of large images, making them indispensable for convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
